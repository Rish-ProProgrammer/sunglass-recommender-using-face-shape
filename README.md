# sunglass-recommender-using-face-shape
A sunglass recommendation system based on face shape, comparing three ML models (SVM, Random Forest and Neural Network)
All models were trained using the face shape dataset from kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/niten19/face-shape-dataset/data)
The final face shape predictions were made using Random Forest due to the evaluation metrics being higher.
The sunglass types corresponding to a face shape were found by referring to multiple online sites.
